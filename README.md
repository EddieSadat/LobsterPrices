Background:  
This project was completed in late 2021. It was a collaborative group project with two other peers (listed in report).
While we all split tasks, I took care a majority of the code and analysis segments.
This was my first project utilizing ANOVA and linear regression with data we collected and concatonated from multiple sources.
